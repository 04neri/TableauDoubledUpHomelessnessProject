# TableauDoubledUpHomelessnessProject
CISS: Doubled-up Homelessness Visualization.

The "Doubled-up Homelessness Visualization" project successfully develops a comprehensive dashboard to visualize and analyze data on doubled-up homelessness across the United States. Highlighting significant regional disparities, the project illuminates the prevalence of this often-overlooked form of homelessness, with data showing that states like California experience notably higher rates compared to others like Vermont. 

This visualization serves as a critical tool for researchers, policymakers, and community leaders, providing a data-driven foundation to inform prevention strategies and policy planning. The project not only enhances understanding of the complexities of homelessness but also underscores the importance of detailed, region-specific data in crafting effective interventions and supports.
