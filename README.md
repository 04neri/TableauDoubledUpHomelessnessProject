# Doubled-Up Homelessness Visualization Project
Boston University, Center for Innovation in Social Science

Homelessness is a critical social issue, but traditional methods for measuring it often undercount or exclude certain forms, like "doubled-up homelessness." This occurs when individuals temporarily stay with friends or family due to housing loss or economic hardship (U.S. Department of Education, 2001). Understanding the extent of doubled-up homelessness is essential, as it often precedes literal homelessness and can inform prevention strategies.

This project aims to develop a dashboard that visualizes and analyzes data on doubled-up homelessness across the United States. By highlighting regional disparities—such as higher rates in states like California compared to Vermont—the dashboard provides a valuable tool for researchers, policymakers, and community leaders. This resource supports data-driven decisions and strategies to address housing insecurity and prevent homelessness more effectively.
